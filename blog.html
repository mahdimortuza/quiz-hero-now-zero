        <h1>Answer of the questions.</h1>
    <h2>1. What is the difference among map, filter, forEach and find?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 
        In JavaScript, map(), filter(), forEach(), and find() are all array methods used to manipulate arrays. Here are the differences among them:
        <ul>
            <li>map() - creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array. It returns a new array with the same length as the original array.</li>
            <li>filter() - creates a new array with all the elements that pass the test provided by a callback function. It returns a new array that may have fewer elements than the original array.</li>
            <li>forEach() - calls a provided function once for each element in the array, but it doesn't create a new array. It simply executes a function on each item in the array.</li>
            <li>find() - returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no element satisfies the function, it returns undefined.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>


    <h2>2. What is the difference among local storage, session storage and cookies?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li> Local storage is used save data on the browser. This data is not accessible from another browser. 
                Local storage is more suitable for storing larger amounts of data that only need to be accessed by the client. </li>
            <li> Session storage is used to store data of a ongoing session. If the user close a session then all of the data are gone.</li>
            <li>Cookies are more suitable for storing small amounts of data that need to be accessed by both the client and server.</li>
        </ul>        
    </p>

    <h2>3. What is event loop and how does it work? </h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 
        The event loop is a crucial part of JavaScript's runtime that handles the execution of asynchronous code. It's responsible for managing the execution of code in a way that maximizes efficiency and responsiveness.

    <h1 style="margin-top: 80px;">Functions are eplained on the down below.</h1>
    <h2>1. quizTimmer function</h2>
    <p>The quizTimer function is used in a quiz application to handle a timer. It takes a boolean parameter to <br>
        dismiss the timer and sets up an interval to update an HTML element with the elapsed time. The function formats the <br>
        time as a string with leading zeros and changes the text color of the HTML element every 60 seconds to create a flashing effect. <br>
        The interval function runs every second until the clearInterval method is called. The quizTimer function is an essential component <br>
        of the quiz application, allowing users to keep track of their progress and providing a visual cue for the time remaining.</p>
    
    
    <h2>2. chooseQuiz function</h2>
    <p>The chooseQuiz function is used in a quiz application to handle the selection of a quiz answer. It takes two parameters, <br>
         index which indicates the index of the quiz question in the quizData array, and givenAns which is the answer selected by the user.<br>

        The function checks if the selected answer already exists in the answers array using the find method. If it exists, the function <br>
        finds the index of the existing answer in the answers array and replaces it with a new answer object that includes the selected answer. <br>
        If it doesn't exist, the function adds a new answer object to the answers array with the selected answer and displays the updated answer list <br>
        using the displayAnswers function.
        
        Overall, the chooseQuiz function allows users to select and update their quiz answers and displays their selections for review.</p>
